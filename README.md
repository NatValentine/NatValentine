ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NatValentine, an aspiring game developer currently working on getting a new job.

Iâ€™m currently taking a back-to-basics approach to programming hoping to learn new things and relearn some I thought I had forgotten.

Right now I'm based in Buenos Aires, Argentina where I'm studying Systems Engineering at the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional and have graduated as a Game Developer from Universidad Abierta Interamericana.

You can find me at [itch.io](https://natvalentine.itch.io/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/natvalentine).

Are you a recruiter? Here's my [resume](https://natvalentine.github.io/Resume/).
