ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NatValentine, an aspiring game developer currently working at Kovix as a full-stack developer.

Iâ€™m currently learning everything Javascript I can for work and in my free time I tackle small game projects, usually in Unity.

Right now I'm based in Buenos Aires, Argentina where I'm studying Systems Engineering at the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional and have graduated as a Game Developer from Universidad Abierta Interamericana.
